This Basic Software Package (BSP) includes
NUC140 interface device driver, learning board driver, and sample code for interfacing with sensor module

In order to use it, you will need to install
1) Keil MDK (v4.7 was used to run the sample codes
2) NuLink USB driver (NuLink is a built-in ICE circuit on NUC140 learning board)
3) unzip this BSP into C:\

Revision History :

2013/5/31
<Revised>
LCD_Driver.c to support draw_LCD(displaybuffer) without array conversion
<Added>
Smpl_ADC_Joystick    : joystick input using ADC
Smpl_CAN_Keypad_Logo : keypad input to print Nuvoton logo on another board through CAN bus
Smpl_USB_Mouse_Keypad: keypad input as USB mouse 

2013/8/26
<Revised>
Smpl_PWM_Tone_Keypad : add Driver_PWM.c , using PWM Speaker (2N2222 soldered on 8 ohm speaker)
<Added>
Smpl_PWM_Music :       play "To Alice", add Pitch array
Smpl_LCD_Game_Invader: a demo of Invader (without bullet and collison detection)
                       added Font5x7.h & printC, printS functions

2013/9/10
<Revised>
Smpl_CAN       : remove conditional print when doing CAN_ShowMSg, double check CAN transmit OK
Smpl_CAN_Timer : remove printing local timer value, Timer interrupt will only do CAN_TX
<added>
Smpl_I2C_MPU6050_angle : calculate anlge from accelerometer value
Smpl_I2C_MPU6050_tilt  : calculate tilt  from accelerometer value
Smpl_LCD_Pingpong: LCD Animation of PingPong
Proj_VacuumCleaner: bluetooth command record/playback

BTButton.zip : an Android 4.2 App sample code 
               for using bluetooth to send command to NUC140 learning board (with a bluetooth module)
